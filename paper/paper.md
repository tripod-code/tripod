# Summary 
'TriPodPy' is code simulating the dust evoltion in protoplanetary dsiks using the model presented in [@Pfeil2024]. It uses this parametric dust evolution model to comute the dust evolution in protoplanetary disks in 1-D whith the advantage that is computationaly significantly cheeper than full coagualation codes like 'Dustpy'[@Dustpy]. In addition to the original algorithm we added description of tracers for the dust and gas and compositional tracking of additional components.
