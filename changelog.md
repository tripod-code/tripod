### Things I have changed in the python vesrsion to make it consistent with PLUTO

- fixed the eternal source term of the shrinkage -> not fully cosnistent yet 
    -same as in Pluto on the timestep but limitng the maximal deviation
- changed the power law to be cosistent wit hthe tripod code sent to me -> different than in the paper 




#### things beyond the PLUTO version that have been changhed 


#### Ideas what should be adapted 
-timescale for the reduction of amax seems odd
